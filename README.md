# Saweba 2: Exordium
---
Saweba 2 Exordium is pretty much a small pre-release demo of Saweba 2, featuring only 1
playable character and 1 playable stage.

Anyways this is the web version of the Exordium lel, if you want to download the desktop
version then go to the [Itch.Io](https://plainsys.itch.io/saweba-2-exordium) link.

Anyways below will just be a small FAQ for those who are some reason interested in this.

---

### Will this be open source?
As of now, probably not though I do plan on releasing the source code (ofc when I clean
up the code a bit ^^;)

### Will there be another playable character?
Uh... yes.

### Is there a Discord server?
[Yes...](https://discord.gg/XffhjaYfDd)

If you do care though, there is a funny event going on where the goal is to beat my stage 1 score c:

### Is it okay to reupload this to my own website?
As long as its something like your own Github.Io website or a personal website that you own (Not something like NewGrounds or Itch.io or GameJolt) then you should be alright. Just be sure to credit me :thumbsup:

### What is your current highscore in stage 1?
> "0034292"

So uhhh goodluck. :thumbsup:

### I found a bug, what do I do?
As of now, if you have a Github account, you can post it as an Issue. If you don't have one then you can also post it in the Discord server.

If you don't feel comfortable with either then uhhh I don't know, I don't feel comfortable sharing my email at least right now, so best I can do is post a comment of it on my Youtube
which should be in my [Overview](https://github.com/PlainSys) page but if you want it now.

[Then here is the link to my YouTub](https://www.youtube.com/@PlainSys/)

It should also be one of the first things linked in [The Trash Ting](https://plainsys.github.io/) so...



Thats about it, I hope you have fun :D
